Overall, there were more male than female research students in the given year. Among all the subjects, male students had a higher enrollment than female students except for linguistics. Although both genders took a strong interest in psychology and natural sciences, two of the most popular subjects, men least preferred linguistics and women mathematics.



Female and male students showed a more or less similar interest in linguistics, psychology and natural sciences. In particular, natural sciences was the most popular of all, showing the same enrollment number of 200. Though very popular, psychology was favored more by men (200) than women (around 170). In linguistics, the situation was the reverse, with more women than men.



However, female and male students showed significant differences in engineering, programming and mathematics. In all three subjects, male dominance was obvious, espeicially in mathematics, which was taken by 200 male students and only around 40 female students. In engineering and programming, the number of female students was roughly half of that of male.

The rapidly ageing demographic is posing an imminent threat to society. In the U.S, it is claimed that by 2050, the ageing population will have reached an unmanageable size, putting a strain on public resources and facilities. This essay will illustrate two ways in which the government can act in the face of the above problem.

In response to **resources** issues, the government can actively explore the prospect of artificial intelligence (AI). one type of crisis of the ageing population is the shortage of hands, both in the gneral labour market and in the elderly care industry. It is inadequate for elderly people to partake in some strenuous and machanical work, such as cleaning and construction. However, with the use of AI, these kinds of repetitive work can be taken up, which frees up human resources for the more advanced work. AI can also be used in elderly care services. For example, it can help to gather biometric data from the elderly and assist them in simple tasks at home. In this way, the lack of human resources can be compensated, which ensures the efficient functioning of society.

In response to **facilities** issues, the government can reallocate the annual budget and invest more in social welfare support. With time, elderly people become more susceptible to diseases, and they definitely call for more medical attention. The government needs to make sure the elderly can get timely treatment in well-equipped placees. As such, the government should allocate enough money to building hospitals and elderly homes, which is important to address this future need.

In conclusion, the crisis brought by the ageing population must be tackled with care. Developing AI technologies and improving social welfare support will be a good way to start.
